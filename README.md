The features we have added include the following;
1. filter winning cars by decade at the navigation bar at the top, also allowing you to see all 100 years
2. scroll the timeline using your mouse wheel or trackpad to go back and forth
3. hover your mouse over the car images to see details of the Car model with a flag of where the car is from, and the drivers who won the race
4. click the car to hear its respective exhaust sound so you are even more immersed in the history of LeMans

Kaleab and I (Jonathan) have created this website to display the entire history of the winning LeMans cars, showing the origins of the most successful companies and racers of all time. Hope you enjoy.
