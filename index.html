            The Le Mans 24 Hours, often referred to as the "Grand Prix of Endurance and Efficiency," is one of the
            world's most prestigious and challenging motorsport events. Held annually near the town of Le Mans, France,
            the race features a grueling 24-hour endurance format where teams of drivers compete to cover the longest
            distance possible. The race takes place on the Circuit de la Sarthe, a combination of public roads and
            purpose-built sections that includes long straights, fast chicanes, and tight corners, testing the limits of
            both man and machine. Teams compete in various classes, including prototypes and GT cars, with manufacturers
            and privateer teams vying for overall victory and class honors. The Le Mans 24 Hours is known for its rich
            history, dramatic battles, and iconic moments, making it a beloved fixture in the world of motorsport and
            attracting fans and enthusiasts from around the globe. The creators of this website (Jonathan and Kaleab)
            have made this website to dedicate to the motorsport turning 100 years old, from 1923-2023 (with the
            exception of World War 2 and other events.)
